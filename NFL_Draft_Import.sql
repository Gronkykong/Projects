/*
This a simple example of a data import and conversion using T-SQL with some analysis mixed in. The data comes from a football mock draft made up of 96 teams 
and 1000's of players. Each player has 8 duplicates to be drafted  Data was captured using a web scraping script and 
imported via SQL server integration services

Notes:
-Data and inserts can be found in this same project directory
-Designed to be run sequentially
